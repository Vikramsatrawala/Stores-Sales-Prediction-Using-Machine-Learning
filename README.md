#### Stores-Sales-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
•	The primary aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that should be able to predict the sales of the different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.

•	Helps to emphasis on products showing high sales value.

•	Reduce the risk of keeping the items in store those are having less buying capacity.

•	Here I use supervised machine learning algorithms –

i)	Multiple Linear Regression(MLR) 

ii)	Random Forest Regression

iii)	XGBoost
